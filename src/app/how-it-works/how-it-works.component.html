  <h2 class="mt-7">THE PROCESS</h2>
  <ol type="1">
    <li class="line-height-4">Place your order for a Premade Design or for a Full Custom Card.</li>
    <li class="line-height-4">You then have to send your plastic card to our lab in Lebanon. You will receive the DELIVERY ADDRESS from us.</li>
    <li class="line-height-4">Put your plastic card in any envelope and mail it.</li>
    <li class="line-height-4">We will receive your card in approx. 2 to 4 working days.</li>
    <li class="line-height-4">
      Upon receipt, we will laser your desired design onto the metal card,
      remove the chip from your plastic card and transplant it onto the metal card.
      We then securely transfer the magnetic stripe data from your plastic
      card to the metal card. For this we need about 1-2 days.
    </li>
    <li class="line-height-4">
      You will receive your great new luxury metal card in the mail together with your old plastic card.
